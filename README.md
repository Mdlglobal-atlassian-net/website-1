# Face to Face

This is the official website of Face to Face.

Face to Face are monthly conversations between diverse, open-minded creatives on difficult topics.

Our conversations arenâ€™t meant to solve problems, but to help you grow. We want
you to walk away from a Messy Meetup feeling stretched, enlightened, and
self-aware.
