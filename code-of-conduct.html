<div class="code-of-conduct">
  <strong>Respect and honor</strong>
  <p>In this space, respect is a right, not a privilege. Everyone has a unique voice
  and unique experiences of their own and we endeavor to respect one another.
  Additionally, we work to center and honor BIPOC, queer, trans, disabled, femme,
  low-income, indigenous, survivors, and anyone from underinvested communities.</p>

  <strong>Confidentiality</strong>
  <p>Please do not record or identify anyone other than yourself about the discussions during the meetings. If you would like, please ask the other individual(s).</p>

  <strong>Speak from the “I”</strong>
  <p>Speak from your own experiences and please don’t try to speak for someone else.</p>

  <strong>Respect people’s identities</strong>
  <p>How others move through the world may be different from you. If you’re unsure,
  it’s okay to ask how they’d prefer to be referred to (be that pronouns, or
  otherwise).</p>

  <strong>Speak & listen with respect</strong>
  <p>Most people don’t intend to cause harm when they speak. If you’re unsure, assume
  positive intent, actively listen and ask exploratory (not accusatory) questions
  to better understand.</p>

  <strong>Expect and accept non-closure</strong>
  <p>These meetups are not meant to center you or your desires. Messy Meetups are meant to provide a space for conversation and you’ll likely leave more confused and with more questions than you had when you arrived. Uncertainty is what makes our meetups special and many conversations might not have a conclusion. That’s okay.</p>

  <strong>Critique ideas, not people</strong>
  <p>It’s easy to get fired up during a conversation that really moves you. When
  you’re excited or emotions running high, take a deep breath and remember that
  one person’s idea doesn’t not represent the sum of that individual. As such,
  please make sure you direct your thoughts about an idea to the idea, not to the
  person who holds the idea or their character.</p>

  <strong>Move up and move back</strong>
  <p>Share responsibility for including each other in the conversation.</p>

  <strong>Speak your truth</strong>
  <p>Be honest and open about your thoughts.</p>

  <strong>Embrace discomfort</strong>
  <p>Discomfort is where growth and change happen for ourselves and each other.
  Please remain open to being uncomfortable, so that everyone may speak their
  truth without fear of judgement.</p>

  <strong>Don’t yuck my yum</strong>
  <p>We all have different likes and tastes. Make sure that Even if you don’t agree
  with someone else’s worldview, it’s not your place to try to convince them
  otherwise.</p>
